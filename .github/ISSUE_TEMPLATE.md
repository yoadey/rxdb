<!--
  # NOTICE: Issues are not a way to contact the maintainer, they are community driven. Do never @ the maintainer!

  If you need help from the maintainer, read this:

  ## Have you found a bug?
  -> Create a pull request where you tried to reproduce the problem or at least have shown that you tried to do so.
  You can start by using the bug-report template: https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/blob/master/test/unit/bug-report.test.ts
     Also read the bug checklist here: https://github.com/pubkey/rxdb/blob/master/orga/bug-checklist.md

  ## Do you have a feature request?
  -> Create a pull request that shows how the RxDB API would change or how the new feature could be used.

  ## Example projects are not the same as a unit test
  -> Pasting a link to a repository which reproduces your problem, does rarely help. The maintainers will not install and run your code for security reasons. All bug reports must run inside of the RxDB test suite.


All issues will be autoclosed after 14 days. If you want your issue to be seen by the maintainer or to be left open, make a PR like described  above.
