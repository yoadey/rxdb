# IndexedDB RxStorage

The IndexedDB [RxStorage](./rx-storage.md) is based on plain IndexedDB and can be used in browsers, [electron](./electron-database.md) or hybrid apps.
Compared to other browser based storages, the IndexedDB storage has the smallest write- and read latency, the fastest initial page load
and the smallest build size. Only for big datasets (more then 10k documents), the [OPFS storage](./rx-storage-opfs.md) is better suited.

While the IndexedDB API itself can be very slow, the IndexedDB storage uses many tricks and performance optimizations, some of which are described [here](./slow-indexeddb.md). For example it uses custom index strings instead of the native IndexedDB indexes, batches cursor for faster bulk reads and many other improvements. The IndexedDB storage also operates on [Write-ahead logging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging) similar to SQLite, to improve write latency while still ensuring consistency on writes.


## IndexedDB performance comparison

Here is some performance comparison with other storages. Compared to the non-memory storages like [OPFS](./rx-storage-opfs.md) and [Dexie.js](./rx-storage-dexie.md), it has the smallest build size and fastest write speed. Only OPFS is faster on queries over big datasets. See [performance comparison](./rx-storage-performance.md) page for a comparison with all storages.

## Using the IndexedDB RxStorage

To use the indexedDB storage you import it from the [RxDB Premium ðŸ‘‘](/premium) npm module and use `getRxStorageIndexedDB()` when creating the [RxDatabase](./rx-database.md).

```ts
import {
    createRxDatabase
} from 'rxdb';
import {
    getRxStorageIndexedDB
} from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-indexeddb';

const db = await createRxDatabase({
    name: 'exampledb',
    storage: getRxStorageIndexedDB({
        /**
         * For better performance, queries run with a batched cursor.
         * You can change the batchSize to optimize the query time
         * for specific queries.
         * You should only change this value when you are also doing performance measurements.
         * [default=300]
         */
        batchSize: 300
    })
});
```


## Overwrite/Polyfill the native IndexedDB

Node.js has no IndexedDB API. To still run the IndexedDB `RxStorage` in Node.js, for example to run unit tests, you have to polyfill it.
You can do that by using the [fake-indexeddb](https://github.com/dumbmatter/fakeIndexedDB) module and pass it to the `getRxStorageDexie()` function.

```ts
import { createRxDatabase } from 'rxdb';
import { getRxStorageIndexedDB } from 'rxdb-premium/plugins/storage-indexeddb';

//> npm install fake-indexeddb --save
const fakeIndexedDB = require('fake-indexeddb');
const fakeIDBKeyRange = require('fake-indexeddb/lib/FDBKeyRange');

const db = await createRxDatabase({
    name: 'exampledb',
    storage: getRxStorageIndexedDB({
        indexedDB: fakeIndexedDB,
        IDBKeyRange: fakeIDBKeyRange
    })
});

```



## Limitations of the IndexedDB RxStorage

- It is part of the [RxDB Premium ðŸ‘‘](/premium) plugin that must be purchased. If you just need a storage that works in the browser and you do not have to care about performance, you can use the [Dexie.js storage](./rx-storage-dexie.md) instead.
- The IndexedDB storage requires support for [IndexedDB v2](https://caniuse.com/indexeddb2), it does not work on Internet Explorer.
